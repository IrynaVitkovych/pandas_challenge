Summary of Analysis:
The analysis focused on district-wide standardized test results, comparing performance between district schools and charter schools. Key observations include the following points:

  1. School Size and Budget Comparison:
District schools are larger in terms of student enrollment compared to charter schools.
Most of district schools also have larger budgets per student compared to charter schools.

  2.Passing Score Discrepancy:
Despite having larger budgets and more students, district schools exhibit lower passing scores compared to charter schools.
Charter schools, with lower budgets and smaller student populations, outperform district schools regarding passing rates.

  3.Top 5 Schools Performance:
The top 5 schools based on overall passing rates are charter schools.
The bottom performing schools are 5 district schools in terms of overall passing rates.

Conclusions:

Impact of School Size and Budget on Performance:
The analysis suggests that having a larger student population and higher budgets per student in district schools does not necessarily translate to better academic performance.
Despite having limited resources, charter schools demonstrate higher passing rates, indicating that factors other than budget size may contribute to success.

Suggestion:

Conducting a financial analysis for each school can provide deeper insights into how budgets are allocated and spent. 
We can provide a comprehensive understanding of how each school utilizes its budget and whether there is a correlation between spending patterns and academic performance. This information will be valuable for making informed resource allocation and budget optimization decisions.
