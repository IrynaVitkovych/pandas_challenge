Module 4

Summary of Analysis:

The analysis focused on standardized test scores, school types, school budgets, and the number of students per school to compare the performance of different schools. Key observations include the following points:

  1. School Size and Budget Comparison:
District schools are larger in terms of student enrollment compared to charter schools.
Most of district schools also have larger budgets per student compared to charter schools.

  2. Passing Score Discrepancy:
Despite having larger budgets and more students, district schools exhibit lower passing scores compared to charter schools.
Charter schools outperform district schools regarding passing rates in math, reading and overall perfomance.

  3. Top 5 Schools Performance:
The top 5 schools based on overall passing rates are charter schools.
The bottom performing schools are 5 district schools in terms of overall passing rates.

Conclusions:

Impact of School Size and Budget on Performance:
The analysis suggests that having a larger student population and higher budgets per student in district schools does not necessarily translate to better academic performance.
Despite having limited resources, charter schools demonstrate higher passing rates, indicating that factors other than budget size may contribute to success.

Suggestion:

Conducting a financial analysis for each school can provide deeper insights into how budgets are allocated and spent. 
We can provide a comprehensive understanding of how each school utilizes its budget and whether there is a correlation between spending patterns and academic performance. This information will be valuable for making informed resource allocation and budget optimization decisions.


While working on this module, I used Google, Xpert Learning Assistant, Chat GPT, and tutor sessions, which helped me build and run the code.
